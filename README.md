# Flutter practice projects

In this repository you will find all of the projects I created motivated by [Academind's Flutter & Dart - The Complete Guide \[2023 Edition\]](https://www.udemy.com/course/learn-flutter-dart-to-build-ios-android-apps/) Udemy course by Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller.

## Project Structure

I have decided to organize all projects in a single repository so as not to clutter my Github repositories. All projects are to be managed within their own branches and then merged into the `projects/main` branch via pull request.

Hence, the latest version of all projects will be available in `projects/main` through the merges aforementioned and each project commit history will be preserved in their respective branches.

### Branches

The branches are named after each project folder e.g. the `hello_world` project's history will be contained in the `projects/hello_world` branch.

Each `projects/*` branch has protection rules that prevent direct commits. A pull request must be opened and approved in order for the changes to be incorporated into the branch.
